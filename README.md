### Responses: 

**Day 1: (08/02/21) :** *Getting Started*

During this program, I aim to improve my knowledge about AI, better understand and use ML & DL in real-life cases, and getting familiar with affective computing and how to implement it. And of course, this is a good opportunity to meet new people with similar interests and forge new friendships.


**Day 2: (09/02/21) :**  *Introduction To Machine Learning (Ml) And Scikit-Learn*

--Supervised & Unsupervised Learning :
We use unsupervised machine learning algorithms in order to find patterns in our datasets and to discover the different relationships therein.
As for supervised learning, we have labeled data and what we learn from that labeled training data, help us to predict outcomes for unforeseen data.

--Scikit-Learn:
Scikit-Learn is built on top of many python librairies such as ( numpy , pandas , matplotlib ... ) , Scikit Learn is only focused on Machine Learning so it is not concerned with the loading, handling, manipulating, and visualising of data.Other packages like pandas , numpy are the best to deal with that kind of tasks.


**Day 3: (10/02/21) :**  *Introduction To ML And Tensorflow*

--Tensors : are multidimensional data arrays .
--Computations ran in the TensorFlow programs is that the result doesn't actually get calculated.



**Day 4: (11/02/21) :**  *What Is Deep Learning?*
Learn more about Deep Learning concepts and when it will be used and the difference with ML.


**Day 5: (12/02/21) :**  *What Are Neural Networks (NN)?*
Learn about the different types of Neural networks (FF- CNN -RNN) 
Learn about the components and concepts of Neural Networks.


**Day 8: (11/02/21) :**  *Introduction To Convolutional Neural Networks (Cnns)*

Getting familiar with CNN using the MNIST dataset .

**Day 9: (11/02/21) :**  *Algorithmic Bias And Data Sets*

--1. How do you think Machine Learning or AI concepts were utilized in the design of this game? 

Collecting historical data , training the model and getting results that can fit with our expectations . 

--2. Can you give a real-world example of a biased machine learning model, and share your ideas on how you make this model more fair, inclusive, and equitable? 

Many companies used similair models in their recrutement process nowadays . In my opinion to make the model more fair , we need to fix the dataset , as the whole workflow depends on it .

**Day 10: (11/02/21) :**  *Neural Network Layers*

Understand the different types of layers of a neural networks and their roles.

-- CNNs are more specialized (image classification mostly )  and efficient  in some cases than the Fully Connected Neural Networks . They are 

**Day 11: (11/02/21) :**  *Neural Network Practice With Mnist Digits*

Playing with the MNIST digits dataset using CNN .

**Day 12: (11/02/21) :**  *Image Classification And Ml*

Image Classification and the famous Cats vs dogs binary classification .

**Day 15: (11/02/21) :**  *Ethics-Driven ML Practice*

Ethics and their impact on the ML & DL applications .

**Day 16: (11/02/21) :**  *Activation Functions*

-The rectified linear activation function (ReLU) is a  simple linear function that will output the input directly if it is positive, otherwise, it will output zero. It has become the default activation function for many types of neural networks because a model that uses it is easier to train and often achieves better performance.
One of the benefits of the relu  is the reduced likelihood of the gradient to vanish and also more computationally efficient to compute than other activation functions .
