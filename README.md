**Day 1: (08/02/21) :** *Getting Started*

During this program, I aim to improve my knowledge about AI, better understand and use ML & DL in real-life cases, and getting familiar with affective computing and how to implement it. And of course, this is a good opportunity to meet new people with similar interests and forge new friendships.


**Day 2: (09/02/21) :**  *Introduction To Machine Learning (Ml) And Scikit-Learn*

--Supervised & Unsupervised Learning :
We use unsupervised machine learning algorithms in order to find patterns in our datasets and to discover the different relationships therein.
As for supervised learning, we have labeled data and what we learn from that labeled training data, help us to predict outcomes for unforeseen data.

--Scikit-Learn:
Scikit-Learn is built on top of many python librairies such as ( numpy , pandas , matplotlib ... ) , Scikit Learn is only focused on Machine Learning so it is not concerned with the loading, handling, manipulating, and visualising of data.Other packages like pandas , numpy are the best to deal with that kind of tasks.


**Day 3: (10/02/21) :**  *Introduction To ML And Tensorflow*

--Tensors : are multidimensional data arrays .



**Day 4: (11/02/21) :**  *What Is Deep Learning?*

**Day 5: (12/02/21) :**  *What Are Neural Networks (NN)?*
